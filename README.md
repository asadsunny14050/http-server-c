# 🕷️ cpider-http-server

A simple, multithreaded HTTP server written in C for serving static files and handling basic POST requests. Built purely for educational exploration of how HTTP servers work under the hood.

- ⚠️ Not production-ready. This project is meant for learning purposes only, designed to help understand systems-level programming, socket handling, and concurrent request processing in C.

## ✨ Usage


### 🏗️ Building:
🐧 Linux or WSL Only

This server runs only on Linux or WSL environments. It uses POSIX threads and Linux socket APIs.
⚙️ With Makefile

Clone the repo and run:

        make

Make sure you're inside a Linux shell or WSL terminal with gcc installed


### 🚀 Running

    ./cpider ./public

Replace ./public with the directory containing your static files.

- Server scans the folder:

- Logs warnings for unsupported file types.

- Fails if the folder is empty.

-  Will attempt to serve index.html at root (/, /home, /index.html).
  
### 📜 Color-Coded Logging

- Logs are colorized for clarity:

### 📨 POST Support

- Only enabled on /contact.

- Accepts form data (Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded).

- Data is parsed and appended to a local .txt file.

- Returns 201 Created on success.

## ✨ Features

### 🧵 Multithreaded Request Handling with Thread Pool

-    Handles multiple clients concurrently using a custom-built thread pool.

- Efficient under load, ready to process many incoming connections without blocking.

- Each client is processed independently, with logging tagged by client (port-based ID).

### ✅ Supports GET and POST

- **GET**: Serves static files with MIME-compliant headers.
- **POST**: Accepts form submissions at /contact. 
Parses application/x-www-form-urlencoded bodies and saves to a .txt file, responding with 201 Created.

### 🧠 Manual HTTP Request Parsing

- Parses the request line and headers manually.

- Rejects malformed requests with 400 Bad Request.

### 🗂️ Static File Serving

- Serves all compatible file types from a user-specified directory.
  
- Automatically appends .html if the path lacks an extension (e.g., /about becomes /about.html).

- Serves fallback homepage if index.html is missing.

- Warns about unsupported file types at startup.

- Large files are read and sent in chunks using multiple write() calls with correct Content-Length.

### 🔄 Persistent Connections (Keep-Alive)

- Supports multiple requests per connection via Keep-Alive.

- Connection closes after timeout or reaching max request limit per socket.

- Each client’s request lifecycle is traced with its own ID (port-based).

### 🧪 Designed for Learning, Not Deployment

This server is not secure, not optimized, and not robust enough for real-world deployment.

It exists solely as a learning experience to explore:

Networking with C sockets

1. HTTP parsing and protocol handling
2. File I/O
3. Multithreaded design using a thread pool
4. Lightweight logging and debugging patterns
